# conversion
Write a service that will provide the following conversion:  * Kelvin to celsius * Pounds to kilograms * Miles to kilometers.
It has the service and the controller with an endpoint that does the conversion. the endpoints are as follows:

http://localhost:8080/the-assessment/Calculation/celsiusToKelvin?value=120
http://localhost:8080/the-assessment/Calculation/milesToKilometers?value=120
http://localhost:8080/the-assessment/Calculation/poundsToKilograms?value=120

120 is just the value that I decide to use for the purpose of this assessment.
